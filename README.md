### Introduction
Flowers are one of the beautiful creations of god and they exist in millions of different
species and colours. Identifying each of them requires a botanist with immense knowledge and
skills. Identifying the scientific names and family of the flower species is complicated too. In
this rising era of technologies most of the impossible are made possible by incorporating
artificial intelligence into real world problems. By introducing machine learning algorithms
such as convolutional neural networks for identifying flower species with just an image would
be a great help for industries like pharmaceuticals and cosmetics. Ancient Ayurveda recognizes
several medicinal benefits in most of the flowers. This paper tries to introduce convolutional
neural networks to efficiently identify a flower by just feeding an image of the flower to be
recognized. Flowers have been used for centuries to convey emotions and communicate
messages, from expressing affection to offering condolences and sympathies. However,
identifying the different flowers and their information is not an easy task.
With the help of machine learning algorithms, it is possible to create a system that can
accurately identify flowers and provide information about their meanings and uses. By
analysing images of different flowers and their associated metadata, machine learning
algorithms can learn to recognize the unique characteristics of each species and match them to
their corresponding meanings.
